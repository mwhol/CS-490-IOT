## Introduction

In this ICP we work with the NAO Robot, trying to get it to do a basic task.

## Objectives

We are to use the program Choreographe to get the NAO robot to speak the current weather.

## Approaches/Methods

We used a bit of python programming to get the weather from OpenWeatherData, transform it to a sentence and then speak it out.

## Workflow

The workflow was pretty simple this time around, once choreographe is started, we created a workflow with one node - 'say' and then messed with the source code until it worked.

## Circuit Diagram

N/A

## Parameters

We used the NAO robot, choreographe and the internet.

## Evaluation

A good assignment, interesting to learn the beginnings on the NAO robot

## Conclusion

Good, it was fun to play around with the robot. I wished it had worked with WiFi, as that would have made it a bit easier to do our testing.
