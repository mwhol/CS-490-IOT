## Introduction

Node-Red is useful at creating IOT frontends. In this ICP we continue to learn Node-Red by using other node types and then combining them.

## Objectives

In this assignment we were to experiment around with some new Node-Red node types including switch, change, rbe, mqtt input/output and others. We were then to take these node types and incorporate them all in a use case.

## Approaches/Methods

I started right in by taking the example flows given in the powerpoint and recreating them, sometimes with a small twist.  Once I got the hang of all the pieces individually I began incorporating them.

## Workflow

The hardest part was working all the different pieces together. For example, how to make http use a file. I googled around for some help, but it was helpful to have all the simple examples from part one to reference.

## Parameters

Node-Red - we made use of the switch, change, range, rbe, file in/out, http, websocket and mqtt nodes.

## Evaluation

Node-Red seems pretty useful, and this assignment did a good job of making it more obvious how it could be used in conjunction with an IOT device like the weatherstation.

## Conclusion

Overall a good assignment, I find the use of Node-Red pretty fun and easy.
